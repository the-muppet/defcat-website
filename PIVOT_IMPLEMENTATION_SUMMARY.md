## Known Limitations

1. **Color Filter UI:** The color filter dropdown is present but not connected to a color picker. Consider adding:
   - Mana symbol buttons
   - Multi-select color picker
   - Use `ManaSymbols` component for UI

2. **Bracket Filter:** UI is ready but requires `bracket` column in `decks` table

3. **Tag Filter:** UI is present but not implemented (requires tags table/column)

4. **Product Images:** Currently showing placeholder icons. Add real images by:
   - Adding `imageUrl` to products in `src/data/products.ts`
   - Uploading images to `/public/images/products/`

## React-Player Benefits

**Why we upgraded from iframe:**
1. **Lazy Loading** - Only loads when needed (better performance)
2. **Platform Support** - YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, SoundCloud, etc.
3. **Light Mode** - Shows thumbnail, loads player on click
4. **Advanced Controls** - Programmatic play/pause, seek, volume
5. **Event Handling** - onReady, onPlay, onPause, onEnded, etc.
6. **No SSR Issues** - Dynamic import prevents server-side rendering errors
7. **Customization** - Hide branding, controls, related videos

**Usage Example:**
```tsx
<VideoPlayer
  videoId="dQw4w9WgXcQ"
  light={true}        // Show thumbnail initially
  controls={true}     // Show player controls
  playing={false}     // Don't autoplay
  muted={false}       // Start with sound
/>
```

## Support

All components follow the existing design system:
- Glass effects (`glass`, `glass-tinted-strong`)
- Tinted styles (`btn-tinted-primary`, `hover-tinted`)
- Mana color theming (`var(--mana-color)`)
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Dark mode support (via `next-themes`)

**Ready for production after configuration! ðŸš€**
